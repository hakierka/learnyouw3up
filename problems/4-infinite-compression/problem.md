YES BOSS! That's how you do it. Now your minions can do tasks on your behalf. They can even re-delegate to others! It's delegations all the way down. One thing to note about delegations is that they're not secrets, they can only be used by the target "audience" - in this case the DID of the workshop. So you can embed in scripts and/or send them in emails or whatever really. They're just a proof that _you_ have been given the capability to do something.
