# Infinite avatar compression!

YAS BOSS! That's how you do it! 

Let's move on.
## Whatâ€™s the Deal with Infinite Compression?
Imagine compressing your data over and over until itâ€™s reduced to its absolute minimum size. While true infinite compression is more of a thought experiment, in this challenge, youâ€™ll get a taste of it by working with Content-Addressed Archives (CARs) and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
 
The DAG is packed into a CAR ðŸš— - beep beep. CAR is kinda like a `tar` file but for DAGs. It's a useful container format for transferring content addressed data over HTTP.

**Hereâ€™s how it works:** when you upload a file, it gets split into smaller pieces called CAR shards. Each of these shards gets a unique identifier called a CID (Content Identifier). When youâ€™ve uploaded all the shards, they come together to form a DAGâ€”a super-organized structure that ties everything up neatly with a root CID.

## Your Task:
1. Start by creating a new file, like ex5.mjs.
2. Upload Content: Youâ€™ll upload a fileâ€”maybe another cat memeâ€”just like you did before. But this time, the file gets split into multiple shards.
```js
const client = await Client.create()
const files = await filesFromPaths(['./awesome-cat-meme.jpg'])
```
3. Print Each Shardâ€™s CID: As each shard is stored, youâ€™ll print out its CID. Think of these as the pieces of your compression puzzle.
```js
const root = await client.uploadDirectory(files, {
  onShardStored: shard => console.log(shard.cid.toString())
})
```
4. Reveal the DAG Root: After all the shards are uploaded, print the CID of the root of the DAG. This is the final piece that ties everything together.
```js
console.log(root.toString())
```

## Why Itâ€™s Awesome:
**Efficiency:** Youâ€™re not just uploading dataâ€”youâ€™re breaking it down and managing it in a super-efficient way.
**Organization:** The DAG structure helps keep your data neatly organized, and the CIDs act as a digital map to navigate it all.

## Next Steps:
**Run the Code:** Try running your code to see the CIDs of each shard and the final DAG root.
**Explore Further:** Think about how this structure could be used in larger projects or how you might expand on it.

Now, itâ€™s your turn to dive into the world of infinite compression! Good luck, and have fun compressing! ðŸš€
