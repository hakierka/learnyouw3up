Ok you’re rolling. You just installed the w3up! Give someone a high five.

The w3up is a UCAN enabled API and client libraries that help you build web3 native applications that store their data on IPFS and Filecoin...for much win!

IPFS uses content addressing (sometimes known as hash addressing) where you refer to data by a "hash" that is created from the data itself. If the data changes, the hash changes. Anyone can store and distribute your data because the hash guarantees the data cannot change. Imagine the caching possibilities!

UCANs are like JWTs with super powers. They’re an essential component in decentralized authorization. They use public key cryptography - so whenever you create a UCAN you _sign it_ with your private key.

The best thing about UCANs is that you can provably delegate “capabilities” that allow others to act on your behalf, without ever sharing your private key. We’ll do some of that later.

IDK if you realised but you just generated your very own private key
